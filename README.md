# Compliance-Risk-Remediation-for-Federal-Healthcare-System-NIST-PCI-DSS-FISMA
Security Governance and Risk Remediation project for a federal healthcare client. Features compliance gap analysis (FISMA/NIST), high-risk control remediation planning (SIEM, PAM, GRC), and creation of a PCI DSS-compliant security policy.


Security Governance & Compliance Remediation (Fielder Medical Center)

This project simulates a comprehensive security engagement with a federally funded healthcare organization (FMC) to address critical deficiencies identified in an official Security Assessment Report (SAR). The focus is on translating technical security gaps into a prioritized risk and remediation strategy aligned with major industry and federal standards.

Challenge

The primary goal was to modernize FMC’s security posture from an outdated, non-compliant state (EoL firewall, lack of MFA/AV) into a resilient framework compliant with FISMA, NIST SP 800-53, and PCI DSS standards.

Methodology & Standards Applied

Risk Management Framework (RMF): Used principles aligned with the NIST RMF, specifically Step 4 (Assess) and Step 5 (Authorize), to justify and prioritize corrective actions.

Compliance Baseline: FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act) and the NIST SP 800-53 controls were the primary governing standards.

Payment Security: Developed remediation plans and policies to meet PCI DSS requirements for the new Point-of-Sale (POS) environment.

Key Deliverables and Outcomes

Risk Analysis (Sections A & B):

Activity: Performed a rigorous gap analysis and High-risk assessment.

Artifacts: Prioritized 5 high-risk controls (AC-6, CA-5, CA-7, RA-3, RA-7) and formally justified remediation over acceptance based on ATO requirements.

Remediation Plan (Section C):

Activity: Developed actionable solutions for governance and technical controls.

Artifacts: Recommended deployment of: Privileged Access Management (PAM), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and a formal GRC platform for POA&M tracking.

Policy Creation (Section D):

Activity: Authored a formal, four-point security policy.

Artifacts: Created a PCI DSS-compliant policy addressing requirements for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Endpoint Antivirus (AV) Management, Vendor Default Hardening, and Firewall Maintenance.

Governance Controls Addressed (NIST SP 800-53)

This project focused heavily on establishing foundational security governance:

AC-6 (Least Privilege): Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

CA-5 (POA&M): Formalizing the tracking of deficiencies.

CA-7 (Continuous Monitoring): Establishing a continuous security monitoring strategy.

RA-3 (Risk Assessment): Mandating updated risk assessments after system changes.

Skills Demonstrated: Governance, Risk Management (NIST SP 800-30), Compliance Auditing, FISMA/NIST Frameworks, PCI DSS Policy Development, Technical Remediation Planning (SIEM/PAM/GRC).
